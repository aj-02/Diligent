## 02/09/26 — ZPP_FORECAST, four refinements from Arnav (points 2, 3, 4)

| # | Point | Cause / change | Where |
|---|-------|----------------|-------|
| 2 | Quarterly sheet must show `BUS_FCST_ADD` before the max-of-two field | `FINAL_QTY` is `nmax( FCST_QTY, BUS_FCST )` (`ZCL_PP_FCST` line ~520). `BUS_FCST_ADD` was only appended in the `gc_show_extras` block, i.e. never on the live sheet | `FORM visible_columns`, quarterly branch — `BUS_FCST_ADD` inserted between `BUS_FCST` and `FINAL_QTY`; the duplicate append in the extras block removed |
| 3 | No popup on save; drop the Save checkbox | `MESSAGES_SHOW` popup ran after every save; `p_save` also saved the whole run before the list was drawn | `p_save` withdrawn, `PERFORM save_all` and `FORM save_all` commented out, `show_log( )` replaced by `result_message( )` — one status line. `show_result( )` un-hides `FCST_NO` / `MESSAGE` after the Save button runs, which is what `p_save` used to do up front |
| 4 | Hide the Legacy checkbox when the switch is blank | New `g_legc_on`, read once in `INITIALIZATION` by `FORM legacy_switch`; `p_legc` carries `MODIF ID LGC` and is suppressed in `AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT` | ASSUMPTION: switch is TVARVC parameter `ZPP_FCST_LEGACY` ('X' / blank). Single reader, so the source swaps in one place |

Point 1 (general upload message instead of "this changed from that") is in
`ZPP_FORECAST_UPLOAD` — not touched in this round.
